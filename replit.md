## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Single-page static website**: Uses a single HTML file with embedded CSS for simplicity and minimal deployment requirements
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first approach with media queries for tablet and mobile compatibility
- **Modern CSS features**: Utilizes CSS Grid/Flexbox for layout, CSS gradients, backdrop filters, and box shadows for visual effects
- **Glassmorphism design pattern**: Semi-transparent containers with backdrop blur effects for a modern aesthetic

### Styling Approach
- **Embedded CSS**: All styles are contained within the HTML file for easy deployment and maintenance
- **CSS custom properties**: Uses modern CSS features like `backdrop-filter` and `rgba()` for transparency effects
- **Typography**: Serif font stack (Georgia, Times New Roman) for elegance and readability
- **Color scheme**: Purple gradient background with white semi-transparent content container

### Layout Strategy
- **Centered layout**: Uses Flexbox to center content both horizontally and vertically
- **Responsive breakpoints**: Single breakpoint at 768px for mobile optimization
- **Scalable typography**: Uses `rem` units for font sizes to ensure accessibility
